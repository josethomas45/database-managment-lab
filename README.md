# Database Management

## Overview

This repository contains my work and exercises on **Database Management** concepts. The repository is designed to provide a thorough understanding of database systems, including relational databases, SQL queries, and database design principles.

### Key Sections:
- **SQL Queries**: Examples of various SQL queries for CRUD operations, joins, subqueries, and more.
- **Database Design**: Covers normalization, entity-relationship diagrams (ERD), and database schemas.
- **Stored Procedures & Triggers**: Demonstrates how to write and use stored procedures, functions, and triggers in databases.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/josethomas45/database_management.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to specific folders**: 
   Each folder contains exercises, examples, or code implementations for specific database topics.

3. **Run SQL queries**:
   To execute the SQL scripts, you can use any SQL database management system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

---

## Key Topics Covered

1. **SQL Queries**:
   - Basic and advanced SQL queries for managing data.
   - Examples include `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and more.

2. **Database Design**:
   - Entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) for visualizing database design.
   - Principles of database normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to optimize database structures.

3. **Stored Procedures and Triggers**:
   - Examples of stored procedures for reusable SQL code.
   - Use of triggers to automate actions in a database.

---

## Requirements

- **MySQL**: Recommended for running the SQL scripts.
- **PostgreSQL** or **SQLite**: Alternatives for running the SQL code.
- **SQL Workbench**: Optional, for visualizing and interacting with databases.
